# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
In preparation for the 'Silver Tsunami', an HR analysis is required to determine the number of retiring employees by role. Their replacements will need to be mentored by existing employees. We genereate a list of current employees sorted by their birth date. Each employees title is counted and printed into a table. Then, employees are selected by mentorship criteria. This is grouped by role and ratios between retirees and mentors are calculated.

## Results
* Total counts for retiring employees and eligible mentors are detailed in the below table:

![Mentorship_Availability](https://github.com/DenverSherman/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/master/Analysis/mentorship_ratio.png)
* Mentee/Mentor ratio are above 50 for each Technique Leader, Senior Engineer, and Senior Staff roles.
* There are no currently eligible manager mentors
* There is critical need for Senior Engineer and Senior Staff expected vacancies are over 50k.

## Summary
90,398 positions will need filling in the wake of the 'silver tsunami'. There is a shortage of mentors for the Technique Leader, Senior Engineer, and Senior Staff roles. No managers are eligible to mentor the management replacements. I suggest that hiring and training increase towards senior positions before PH suffers complications with labor shortages.
